<h1>Exploring the role of AI in Transforming Education</h1>

<h2>Why is this important?</h2>

</ul><p>Now that learning and teaching on computers has become ubiquitous across many countries, AI will play key roles in revolutionizing what it means 'to learn' moving forward. </p>
<p>As artificial intelligence (AI) continues its rapid evolution, its having notable effects on education - enabling unique learning experiences and automating administrative tasks such as grading, plagiarism detection amongst many others. However there remain untapped potentials with regards to how best to harness this technology in classrooms for optimal student outcomes.
We will research the opportunities, risks and ethical concerns of AI regarding education and learning.</p>

<h2>Why did we choose this topic?</h2>

<p>As aspiring computer scientists passionate about innovation with positive social impact at our core; understanding how best to implement evolving technological solutions such as those that employ Artificial Intelligence(AI) will be important as digitalization increasingly permeates various aspects of life.</p>

<h2>Team Roles</h2>

<p>We are a team of only two members so we canâ€™t have too many roles. Therefore, we needed an effective role allocation that two people could handle. Our strengths were different so we decided on our roles accordingly.</p>
<p>Jeri: designing the website, citations and referencing</p>
<p>Daniel: writing on the website, designing presentation slides</p>
<p>We both collaborate on researching the topic of AI in education and writing on the final presentation.</p>
